(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>

    <td>Last term, I remember doing work with If and else so that's how I created my quiz, with if and else statements combined with some other knowledge of repl.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>There was no teacher to ask for help if there was an error that was very hard to fix, although I wouldnâ€™t rely on the teacher, if there is something that no one can help with then it is nice to have a teacher to ask.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will try to include things that will recognise typing errors, because if somebody has the right answer but types it slightly wrong it will effect their answer.</td>
  </tr>
