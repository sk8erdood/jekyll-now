    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To create my first account on Github and complete the Google Docs template to publish on my website.</td>

    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>I think so,  I followed all the instructions and came to the point i should have done at the end.</td>

    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Mainly by following all the steps i heard by listening and asking if i got stuck.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Whenever i became unsure and tried to fix it myself, sometimes i would click the wrong things which made my problem worse, especially when there were so many options on screen which made the task quite difficult. Finding a strategy to memorise what the teacher tells us during the demonstration could help me remember what to do.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Stop whatever i am doing if the teacher starts to demonstrate the next step so i don't miss out any steps because that could change everything if i missed something. This will help me work better alone and get on with the task quicker.</td>
