    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>I had a basic understanding of how Github worked,.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To try and make the appearance of my blog look interesting and appealing to me, by experimenting with different coding.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes, for me personally because i managed to carry out tasks that i found difficult and a challenge that worked out in the end.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Mainly by following all the steps i heard by listening and asking if i got stuck, but also trying out various things and asking my peers for help if the teacher was unavailable.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I particularly found it difficult when Github would take 5-10 minutes to apply my new changes, as i would be left wondering if i had done the right thing. Most of the lesson was independent work, so my mistakes didn't fall under not listening, but i could have asked around to confirm if the same thing had happened to other (Github taking a while to apply changes) to speed up how i worked.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Be sure to ask people around me for help and not just wait until the teacher has finished talking to a different student, that way i will get more done in the provided time.</td>
  </tr>
