    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>Understanding of more coding to do with style, e.g. backgrounds and colour.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>Furthering what we did last week, continuing to make our blog look better by using things like shadows and borders and changing the colour/transparency.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes, partly, i achieved most of what I wanted but didn't manage to add on lots more, but was happy with the end results.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Mostly by asking people in the class rather than the teacher because if he was busy and I waited, it became time consuming.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>For the most part, I found it hardest when Github would take a little long to apply changes, as i would be left wondering if i had done the right thing and it was hard to know if I should move on. 
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>If i am sure that the coding is right but it's taking a while to be applied then i will move on to the next thing instead of waiting to see if it has worked or not that way i will save a lot of time.</td>
  </tr>
